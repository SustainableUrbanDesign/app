# Welcome to Sustainable Urban Design Space

> "An Urban Designer's best friend" -- Kyle and Max

This project is in early stages of research and experimentation.

## Project brief
The primary mission of this project is to provide a user-centric experience for designing sustainable urban environments.

## Goals
This project has several goals to inform the development roadmap:

- help urban designers keep in mind high-level concepts like utilities, human services, education, and transportation while rapidly iterating on sustainable urban design ideas
- provide a game-like experience (e.g. [SimCity](https://github.com/SimHacker/micropolis) and [Cities Skylines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities:_Skylines)) that gives direct feedback to end-user actions and helps people focus on specific tasks
- allow people to interact with the application without the need to install any software (other than a web browser) and on portable devices such as tablet computers

## Guidelines
Please observe the following guidelines when contributing to this project:

- be friendly and forgiving
- adopt a lean approach to development, adopting tools and features only when they are needed
- feel free to experiment and fail -- "no shame in the game"
- build on existing efforts -- there are great tools and collaborators in the open-source community (see: [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/))
