# Overview
Sustainable Urban Design Space (SUDS) helps people assess and improve the sustainability of urban environments. The following sections describe the main SUDS concepts.

## Create a project
Projects allow people to collaborate on urban analysis and design for a specific geographic area of interest. Sub-projects enable people to focus on smaller areas related to a larger initiative. For example, a group of people may be working to improve the sustainability of a city with sub-groups responsible for districts within the broader urban environment. 

## Choose metrics
Metrics are measurements of urban environments and are used to define goals in quantifiable terms. Some standard metrics include air quality, traffic congestion, and proximity to services like schools or parks.

## View the situation
A project dashboard shows key metrics on a map or in various types of charts. The dashboard provides insight into the current situation.

## Set goals
Project owners can define one or more goals for their urban environment. For example, "improve air quality by 80%" or "ensure all residents are within 5km of a public park."

## Identify opportunities
Once project owners have clarity on goals, they can use the data dashboard to find opportunities for improvement. For example, it may be immediately apparent that a neighbourhood lacks access to convenient food sources or recreational opportunities.

## Find inspiration
A shared urban design pattern library showcases related ideas from other cities around the world.

## Share ideas
Urban designers and community stakeholders can share, and collaborate on, design ideas to improve opportune areas. They can use any standard design tools and upload design artefacts to a shared project workspace.

## Peer review
Peers and community stakeholders can review design ideas to help find strengths and weaknesses while converging on the best results.

## Track progress
As the project progresses, the data are kept up-to-date with new observations allowing project stakeholders to track progress towards goals and see the result of their designs.

## Measure impact
An impact report describes how effectively the design improved the urban environment respective to the project goals.
