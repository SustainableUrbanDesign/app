Mission The mission of this project is to provide a user-centric platform for urban analysis and design with an emphasis on sustainability. Goals This project has several goals to inform the development roadmap: help urban designers keep in mind high-level concepts like utilities, human services, education, and transportation while rapidly iterating on sustainable urban design ideas provide a game-like experience (e.g. SimCity and Cities Skylines ) that gives direct feedback to end-user actions and helps people focus on specific tasks allow people to interact with the application without the need to install any software (other than a web browser) and on portable devices such as tablet computers Guidelines Please observe the following guidelines when contributing to this project: be friendly and forgiving adopt a lean approach to development, adopting tools and features only when they are needed feel free to experiment and fail -- \"no shame in the game\" build on existing efforts -- there are great tools and collaborators in the open-source community (see: OSGeo )","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"\"An Urban Designer's best friend\" -- Kyle and Max This project is in early stages of research and experimentation.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#mission","text":"The mission of this project is to provide a user-centric platform for urban analysis and design with an emphasis on sustainability.","title":"Mission"},{"location":"#goals","text":"This project has several goals to inform the development roadmap: help urban designers keep in mind high-level concepts like utilities, human services, education, and transportation while rapidly iterating on sustainable urban design ideas provide a game-like experience (e.g. SimCity and Cities Skylines ) that gives direct feedback to end-user actions and helps people focus on specific tasks allow people to interact with the application without the need to install any software (other than a web browser) and on portable devices such as tablet computers","title":"Goals"},{"location":"#guidelines","text":"Please observe the following guidelines when contributing to this project: be friendly and forgiving adopt a lean approach to development, adopting tools and features only when they are needed feel free to experiment and fail -- \"no shame in the game\" build on existing efforts -- there are great tools and collaborators in the open-source community (see: OSGeo )","title":"Guidelines"},{"location":"impact/","text":"Impact mapping This page describes some specific, actionable, measurable goals that should guide the project development.

The following sections describe the main SUDS concepts. Create a project Projects allow people to collaborate on urban analysis and design for a specific geographic area of interest. Sub-projects enable people to focus on smaller areas related to a larger initiative. For example, a group of people may be working to improve the sustainability of a city with sub-groups responsible for districts within the broader urban environment. Choose metrics Metrics are measurements of urban environments and are used to define goals in quantifiable terms. Some standard metrics include air quality, traffic congestion, and proximity to services like schools or parks. View the situation A project dashboard shows key metrics on a map or in various types of charts. The dashboard provides insight into the current situation. Set goals Project owners can define one or more goals for their urban environment. For example, \"improve air quality by 80%\" or \"ensure all residents are within 5km of a public park.\" Identify opportunities Once project owners have clarity on goals, they can use the data dashboard to find opportunities for improvement. For example, it may be immediately apparent that a neighbourhood lacks access to convenient food sources or recreational opportunities. Find inspiration A shared urban design pattern library showcases related ideas from other cities around the world. Share ideas Urban designers and community stakeholders can share, and collaborate on, design ideas to improve opportune areas. They can use any standard design tools and upload design artefacts to a shared project workspace. Peer review Peers and community stakeholders can review design ideas to help find strengths and weaknesses while converging on the best results. Track progress As the project progresses, the data are kept up-to-date with new observations allowing project stakeholders to track progress towards goals and see the result of their designs. Measure impact An impact report describes how effectively the design improved the urban environment respective to the project goals.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#overview","text":"Sustainable Urban Design Space (SUDS) helps people assess and improve the sustainability of urban environments.
